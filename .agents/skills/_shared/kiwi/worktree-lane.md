# worktree-lane — how a run creates a worktree and works inside it — SSOT v1.0.0 (Codex Kiwi skills)

Shared by `kiwi-orchestrator` and `kiwi-wave-master`. Neither restates this procedure; both name this
file in their §0. One responsibility split across two documents is the failure where one copy gets
corrected and the other silently diverges.

Governing requirements: `FR-FLOW-122` (this contract), `FR-NODE-186` (topology and the role gate),
`FR-NODE-185` (replay admission and checkpointing), `FR-FLOW-121` (`--defer-srs-mutation`).

## 1. Two roots — name them apart first

| Name | What it is | What it owns |
|---|---|---|
| **run root** | the host checkout the MCP workspace is bound to | Requirement ID allocation, **every SRS mutation**, index roll-up, `waves.jsonl`, the run lock |
| **lane workspace** | a git worktree the run created | code and test edits, and commits on its own branch — nothing else |

**The MCP root cannot move mid-session.** It is bound to the server process's working directory and
there is no restart facility. So this design does not move the session into the worktree: the host
stays put and reaches into the lane with `--root`. The direction is host → lane, one way.

That is an asset rather than a restriction: the MCP surface has no way to address a lane at all, so a
lane holding an MCP handle still cannot touch its own worktree through it.

---

## 2. Creating one — never trust the default head

```
git worktree add <lane-root> -b kiwi/orch/{run_id}/{lane_key} <base_sha>
```

**Pass the base as the third argument — never split this into two commands.** `add -b BR` followed by a
separate `checkout <base_sha>` creates the branch at the current tip and then DETACHES HEAD from it.
The lane's commits pile up on a detached HEAD while the branch stays put — reproduced. The "commits on
its own branch" that §1 lists as the lane's property then do not exist, §5's `base..head` check reads
zero for a lane that did work, and removing the worktree leaves those commits unreferenced.

Where a single command is not possible — a runtime handed you the worktree already made — use
`git -C <lane-root> switch -C <branch> <base_sha>`, which moves the branch to the base and leaves HEAD
ATTACHED to it. `checkout <sha>` is never the answer.

**Naming the base is itself not optional.** Measured: a runtime-created worktree opened at
`origin/<default-branch>`, **114 commits behind** the branch under work. A diff produced on that base
**merges cleanly**, so nothing afterwards reveals that months-old code was edited.

A worktree shares the object database, so it can move to a commit created **after** the worktree
existed — confirmed by measurement. That is what makes "start on the previous unit's integration tip"
mechanically possible.

**Bootstrap** finishes before the host puts an agent into the lane:

```
npm ci --include=dev --ignore-scripts
```

`--include=dev` is load-bearing. Under `NODE_ENV=production` npm's effective config becomes
`omit=dev`, and `npm ci` then **silently omits devDependencies and exits 0**. The lane reports green
from a toolchain that has no test runner. `--include=dev` cancels that setting without depending on
shell syntax.

## 3. Three things a lane never does

1. **Never calls an SRS mutation.** It only records into the queue given by
   `--defer-srs-mutation <path>`. Recording is not skipping — the four mutations are still accounted
   for, and the host replays them.
2. **Never commits under `docs/spec/`.** A lane's commits are confined to its own `write_set`
   pathspec.
3. **Never passes `--root`.** The moment `--root` appears it is an orchestrator operation, not lane
   work.

All three are checkable by the host **without the lane's self-report** — the commit range over the
shared object database is enough.

---

## 4. The gate — is the difference planned?

The run-root check does not ask whether two roots are equal. It asks whether their **difference
belongs to the frozen plan**. The `role` is **declared** by the caller, and the tool corroborates that
declaration against the repository itself.

| role | passes when |
|---|---|
| `host` | the two roots agree and that root is **not** a linked worktree |
| `lane` | the git common dir matches the host's, the top level differs, the common dir has it
**registered**, `lane_id` is in the frozen lane plan, and that lane's `write_set` touches no
`docs/spec/` path |

The discriminator is the **git common directory**: every linked worktree of one repository reports the
same one while reporting a different top level, and the caller chooses neither value.

Why `role` is not inferred: "these roots differ but share a common dir, so this must be a lane" is
satisfied by **any** worktree of the repository, including one the run never planned. Membership in the
plan is the part the caller did not choose.

---

## 5. The verdict — a lane's green is not the verdict

A lane running its own `verification_cmd` is a fast-failure device. **The verdict comes from the
host**, which sets its working directory to the lane workspace and runs the same verification command
once itself.

The reason is the trap in §2. A lane missing devDependencies believes it is green. Running it from the
host exposes that immediately.

What the host confirms from the commit range:

```
base..head commit count is non-zero        (something happened)
base is an ancestor of head                (it happened on the right baseline)
changed paths  ⊆ write_set                 (it happened inside the lease)
changed paths  ∩ docs/spec/ = empty        (SRS was left alone)
```

---

## 6. Replay — only what is admitted, only once

The host plans the harvested queue (`orchestrate replay plan`) and applies **only what is admitted**.

The admitted set is the four of `kiwi-coder §0.12`, and it is a **module constant** — an allowlist a
call site can widen is not an allowlist.

```
add_trace_link · add_verification_evidence · update_status · add_completed_work
```

Any other tool name is refused as `tool-not-deferrable`. A call carrying a target other than the frozen
one is refused as `target-not-frozen`. **The queue is written by the lane** — not trusting the queue is
the defence; trusting where the queue sits is not.

`add_completed_work` and `add_verification_evidence` append, so resuming an interrupted run naively
duplicates rows. Remaining calls are reduced from an **append-only record**, one line per attempt. A
call the record shows failed is reported as failed and is not silently retried — retrying is a decision
for the caller to make with the failure in hand.

---

## 7. Teardown

**Never reap before harvest.** Removing the worktree evaporates the gitignored artefacts inside it. The
order is always harvest → verify → integrate → release.

**Never re-dispatch a lane that is still alive** (`git worktree list --porcelain` reporting
`locked … (pid N)`). Unlike a session name, a worktree is a disk artefact and therefore survives
resumption — that is a side benefit of coordinating this way.
