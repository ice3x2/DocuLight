# `--auto` shared option for Codex Kiwi skills

This reference is the Codex-local SSOT for `--auto` user-gate handling across
`kiwi-*` skills. Load it only when a skill declares `--auto` support and reaches
a user-decision gate.

## Definition

When `--auto` is active, a recoverable user-decision gate can be decided by an
isolated Codex sub-agent using only task-local evidence, explicit options, and
the skill's safety rules. The main agent must not pass its preferred answer or
private rationale to the decision worker.

Every skill that uses this reference must declare `critical_gates[]`. A matching
critical gate halts for user input even when `--auto` is active.

## Activation

Check channels in order:

| Channel | Activation rule |
|---|---|
| Explicit skill request | Invocation text or delegated prompt contains `--auto` as a token. |
| User prompt | User message contains an exact `--auto` token. |
| Natural language | "자동", "묻지 말고", "확인 없이", "auto", "바로 진행", or "질문 없이"; confirm once before enabling if the phrase is ambiguous. |
| Parent propagation | A parent Kiwi skill that is already in `--auto` mode delegates to this skill and includes `--auto`. |

Silent skip cases:

- The skill does not reference this file.
- The skill references this file but does not declare `critical_gates[]`.
- `kiwi-srs-research --mode=subagent`, where mutation and user-gate handling are intentionally disabled.

Record active flags in the skill's preflight or analysis log, for example
`mode_flags: ["--auto", "--max"]`.

## Decision Committee

When a gate option carries the structured marker `recommended: true`, no committee is convened at
all — see the decision rule below. Otherwise, when `--auto` is active, convene a research-performing
decision committee of 3 members that investigates the gate context (research) and votes for the most
reasonable option to adopt (select), instead of a single rubber-stamp worker. Under `--auto --max`
the decision committee is raised to 5 members. The committee decides by **simple majority** — the
option holding strictly more than half of the votes cast — and adopts that option immediately;
unanimity is not required. Committee members are isolated sub-agents spawned in a single message (3
for `--auto`, 5 for `--auto --max`) and inherit the current session model unless `--model <name>`
overrides the committee model (no dual-model evaluator panel). Members are numbered for
identification only; no member's vote outweighs another's. Use current Codex delegation tools; if
delegation is unavailable, halt instead of guessing for high-risk gates.

Each committee member receives the same worker input and returns the same JSON vote.

Worker input:

- `gate_id`
- `gate_context`
- `options[]`, when the original gate has explicit options
- `severity`: `clarification`, `business-decision`, or `rollback-confirmation`
- `safety_rules[]` copied from the active skill
- `available_evidence`, such as test output, MCP response, git status, or diff

Never pass:

- the main agent's tentative answer
- another worker's result before a merge step
- hidden preference from the caller
- unrelated conversation history

Required worker output is raw JSON:

```json
{
  "decision": "option-id-or-enum-value",
  "rationale": ["reason 1", "reason 2", "reason 3"],
  "risk_assessment": "low|medium|high",
  "side_effects": ["effect"],
  "fallback_if_decision_fails": "next step",
  "confidence": 0.0
}
```

## Decision Rule (recommended fast path -> default_if_auto -> simple majority)

Resolve a `--auto` gate in this order. The two bypasses rank `recommended` > `default_if_auto` >
committee: an option carrying **both** markers resolves through the `recommended` branch, and a gate
whose options carry **neither** marker reaches the committee.

0. **`recommended` fast path (zero votes).** If a gate option carries the structured marker
   `recommended: true`, `--auto` adopts that option immediately. No committee is convened and no
   committee member is spawned. No votes are counted, so no confidence comparison is made.
   - The marker is a structured boolean field declared on `kiwi-pm`'s `NEEDS_USER` option schema
     beside `key`, `label` and `consequence`. It is opt-in: an option without the field is not
     recommended.
   - A prose `(권장)` label in skill text carries **no machine meaning** and is **never parsed** as a
     recommendation. Two of the three such labels in `kiwi-pm` annotate a HALT option, so a prose
     scan would auto-adopt a recommended HALT.
   - This contract does not judge **why an option is recommended** — it declares no field describing
     the motive and no criterion for weighing it.
1. **`default_if_auto` fast path (zero votes).** With no `recommended` option, a gate that declares
   `default_if_auto` adopts that default. No committee is convened.
2. **Committee simple majority.** With neither bypass present, convene the committee at its declared
   size (3 for `--auto`, 5 for `--auto --max`) and adopt the option holding strictly more than half
   of the votes cast, immediately, recording the union of `side_effects`. Unanimity is not required
   — a 2-1 among 3 members decides on the spot. The committee size is fixed by the table above and
   does not change during the decision; the vote is taken once.
3. **No majority -> `critical` and halt.** If no option holds more than half of the votes — a 1-1-1
   among 3 members under `--auto`, or a tie among 5 members under `--auto --max` — escalate the gate
   to `critical` and halt for the user. A tie is one form of no majority and is handled the same
   way. The committee size stays as it is, the vote is not taken again, and no single member settles
   the outcome alone.
4. Critical gates and business decisions listed in `critical_gates[]` still halt for the user under
   `--auto`; neither the committee nor a fast path ever overrides a critical halt.
5. Record the decision in `docs/analysis/{run-id}/auto_decisions.json` (see Logging). The
   `merge_method.rule` vocabulary is exactly `majority`, `recommended-fastpath` and
   `default-if-auto`; `unanimous` is recorded as a vote outcome, never as a rule.

**Prohibited**: adopting a decision that is neither a committee simple majority nor a declared
`recommended: true` / `default_if_auto` bypass — halt immediately. A zero-vote fast-path adoption is
a declared bypass and is not caught by this prohibition.

Normalize `decision` by trimming whitespace and comparing lowercased exact option IDs; do not
use substring matching. A member that returns free text instead of an option ID is treated as
a failed member.

Failure handling:

| Failure | Action |
|---|---|
| Member timeout, empty response, invalid JSON, or missing `decision` | Retry that member once; if it still fails, the quorum is degraded: escalate to `critical` and halt, unconditionally. Do not drop the member and continue. |
| A majority of members fail | Halt for user input. |

With 3 members and one dropped, the remaining two have no majority in a 1-1, and continuing from
there is single-agent decision-making. A degraded quorum therefore gets the same treatment as step
3's no-majority result.

## Severity Policy

| Severity | `--auto` behavior |
|---|---|
| `clarification` | Worker decision may proceed with adjusted confidence >= 0.5. |
| `business-decision` | Worker decision may proceed with adjusted confidence >= 0.7 unless the gate is in `critical_gates[]`. |
| `rollback-confirmation` | Worker may approve only narrow rollback actions described by the original gate; destructive broad resets still halt. |
| `critical` | Halt for user input. |

If a gate has no explicit severity, classify it as `critical` when it matches
`critical_gates[]`; otherwise classify it as `business-decision`.

Adjust confidence before applying:

| Condition | Adjustment |
|---|---|
| Fewer than 3 rationale items | multiply by 0.7 |
| Average rationale item shorter than 20 characters | multiply by 0.8 |
| `risk_assessment=high` and confidence > 0.7 | multiply by 0.6 |
| Mutation, push, PR, or status gate with empty `side_effects[]` | multiply by 0.7 |

These adjustments apply to **each member's** confidence individually.

**Governing confidence.** After the per-member adjustments are applied, take the **minimum** among
the members who voted for the adopted option — the winning bloc. When the vote is unanimous the
winning bloc is the whole committee. Under a split vote (2-1 and so on) this value is not the mean
of the winning bloc, not the minimum or mean across all members, and not the lead member's
confidence: a dissenting member's confidence, whatever its value, does not enter the comparison.
Only this one value is compared against the threshold in force (`clarification` 0.5,
`business-decision` 0.7, each raised by the +0.1 lower-tier model adjustment below when it applies),
and only a result under that threshold escalates the gate to `critical`.

Worked cases for a `business-decision` gate at the 0.7 threshold:

| Vote | Adjusted confidence in the winning bloc | Governing | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2-1 | 0.9, 0.6 | 0.6 | under 0.7 -> escalate to `critical` and halt |
| 2-1 | 0.9, 0.75 | 0.75 | at or above 0.7 -> adopt (the dissenter's value is excluded) |

Committee confidence cross-check, folded into the threshold mechanism above: a spread of 0.3 or more
between the highest and lowest member confidence is **recorded** in the decision audit row as
`confidence_spread` and **drives nothing** on its own. The spread affects neither the vote nor the
committee's composition, and it **supplies no confidence adjustment of its own** — no de-rating
factor is defined for it beyond the four per-member factors above. What residual effect a wide
spread has is carried by those per-member adjustments and by the governing-confidence rule, and
`critical` escalation comes from that single threshold comparison. A unanimous committee reporting a
spread of 0.3 or more therefore adopts its decision and does not halt, as long as its governing
confidence stays at or above the threshold.

When `--auto --model <name>` overrides the committee model, increase the confidence thresholds
by 0.1 only when the named model is a lower tier than the current session model. Model tier
SSOT (highest to lowest): `opus` > `sonnet` > `haiku`; compare the named and session models
deterministically by this ranking (equal or higher tier -> no change, e.g. session `sonnet` +
`--model opus`). Safe default: if the named model is not in the ranking or the session model is
unknown so the comparison is impossible, always apply +0.1 (treat the unknown model as
lower-capability).

## `critical_gates[]`

Declare critical gates in the active skill near the common rules or the relevant
gate table.

Minimum table columns:

| gate_id | reason | location |
|---|---|---|
| `external-module-impact` | cwd 외부 path 영향 | §0.G2 |

Recommended catalog:

- `external-module-impact`
- `protected-branch-direct-push`
- `fork-repo-pr-create`
- `stability-stable-promotion`
- `stability-frozen-violation`
- `sha-mismatch-on-resume`
- `depends-on-violation`
- `t-final-backward-transition`
- `push-conflict-rebase-merge-choice`
- `mcp-unavailable`
- `transition-guard-bypass`
- `mock-detection`
- `plan-code-divergence-critical`
- `self-recursive-spawn`
- `pipeline-event-needs-user-or-failed`

`lifecycle-gate-draft` is **retired** — draft blocking was replaced by per-REQ skip (FR-FLOW-053) and the id was dropped from the canonical gate set of every pipeline skill, starting with `kiwi-pm`. New skills must not adopt it.

## Read-Time Interpretation

For a skill that references this file:

- "Codex clarification gate" means `critical_gates[]` match halts; otherwise
  `--auto` may use the decision committee (see Decision Committee and Decision
  Rule).
- `NEEDS_USER` payloads are decision gates. In child mode, return the payload to
  the parent only when the gate is critical or delegation is unavailable.
- An option marked `recommended: true` is adopted immediately with no committee — the top-ranked
  fast path (Decision Rule step 0). A prose `(권장)` label is not this marker.
- `default_if_auto` may be applied directly for low-risk clarification gates
  with confidence 1.0. A `recommended` option outranks it.
- Normal SRS reads, mutations, status/stability changes, evidence, trace links,
  and completed-work logging still require `speckiwi mcp`; CLI may only help
  diagnose or remediate MCP setup.

## Propagation

When a parent Kiwi skill delegates to a child Kiwi skill:

| Parent flags | Child flags |
|---|---|
| `--auto` | `--auto` |
| `--auto --max` | `--auto --max` |
| `--auto --model <name>` | `--auto --model <name>` |
| `--auto --max --model <name>` | `--auto --max --model <name>` |

> **Loop round-cap propagation (FR-FLOW-035)**: the child-propagation SSOT for `--mini` / `--loops N` (verify/improve loop round cap) is `_shared/kiwi/loop-option.md` §6. They propagate parent→child exactly like `--auto`, additive to the table above — e.g. `kiwi-pm --loops 5` → `kiwi-coder --loops 5`, `kiwi-pipeline --mini` → every sub-skill `--mini`.

> **One named flag may imply a set (FR-FLOW-119)**: a parent never synthesises a child's gate-bypassing options by itself. A single flag the user named explicitly is not that case — `kiwi-wave-master`'s `--drive`, declared to turn on `--auto-integration` and `--auto-cost-warning`, is still explicit user input, so the rule below does not bar it. What the rule bars is a parent inventing those flags with no user input at all.

Special propagation:

| Parent | Child | Added flags |
|---|---|---|
| `kiwi-hot-fix --auto` | `kiwi-srs-sync` | `--auto` only; never add `--auto-apply` or `--yes-all` unless the user explicitly supplied those flags |
| `kiwi-pm --auto` | `kiwi-coder` | `--auto`; add `--model <name>` or `--max` only when the parent explicitly has those flags |
| `kiwi-coder --auto` standalone close handoff | `kiwi-review-fix-loop` | `--close-reqs --auto`, plus inherited `--model <name>` or `--max` |

## Logging

Append or write `docs/analysis/{skill-run-id}/auto_decisions.json`, recording **every adoption**,
including the two zero-vote bypasses — otherwise the decisions that received no deliberation would
be the ones leaving no evidence.

The `merge_method.rule` vocabulary is exactly `majority`, `recommended-fastpath` and
`default-if-auto`; no other value is written. `unanimous` is recorded as a `vote_outcome`, never as
a rule. A gate escalated to `critical` is not an adoption and belongs in `critical_halts[]`.

A zero-vote bypass carries `committee_size: 0` and `marked_by` (the gate declaration site), with
`committee_votes` as an **empty array** — an empty array is a claim that there were no members, an
absent field is silence.

## Compatibility Notes

- `kiwi-pm`: `business-decision` is no longer an automatic hard halt. It can be
  decided by `--auto` unless the gate is listed in `critical_gates[]`.
- `kiwi-srs`: QnA suppression remains its local `--auto` behavior; external and
  scope-boundary gates must be listed as critical.
- `kiwi-srs-sync`: `--auto-apply` and `--yes-all` still skip the dry-run approval
  gate only when the user explicitly supplied them; parent `--auto` must not
  create those flags. `--auto` uses decision workers for gates and may choose
  apply-all, apply-selected, dry-run-only, or abandon.
- `kiwi-review-fix-loop`: finding severity classification is separate from
  `--auto` gate decisions.
